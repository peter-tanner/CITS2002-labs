/*
* ðŸŒ¶ Lecture 6 introduced C11's structures and presented an example of how
  application programs can request and receive information from the underlying
  operating system The example involved the gettimeofday() system-call and the
  struct timeval structure.
* Similarly, applications can determine information about a file's attributes
  using the stat() system-call and the struct stat structure. Note that we need
  to read Section 2 of the online manual:

	prompt> man 2 stat
	
  otherwise we'll receive the documentation from Section 1.

* Write a program which accepts a number of filenames on the command-line, and
  prints (just as an integer) the modification-time of each file.
* Now, extend the program to also print each file's size (in bytes) and the
  (more useful string) modification-time of each file, using the ctime()
  function.
