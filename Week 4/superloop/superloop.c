/*
 * ðŸŒ¶ ðŸŒ¶ ðŸŒ¶ If you had to write some code that iterated through all the
  possibilities for three variables in the range 0 to 10, you would probably
  write code similar to:

    for(int a = 0; a < 10; ++a) {
        for(int b = 0; b < 10; ++b) {
            for(int c = 0; c < 10; ++c) {
                ; // LOOP-BODY USING a, b, AND c
            }
        }
    }
  But what if you had to extend this to 4, 5, or even 10+ "nested" loops?
  Instead of further nesting more loops, it is possible to write a function that
  acts as a "superloop", performing the equivalent of n nested loops with just
  one loop. Write a function to do this, taking an argument n that indicates the
  number of nested loops your function should perform. To do this, you will need
  to keep a 1-dimensional array of n values that maintain the state of each loop
  during the execution of your function.
